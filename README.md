#Steps to Create a Basic Calculator in Python:
Define functions: For each mathematical operation, you define a function that takes two inputs (numbers) and returns the result of that operation.

Get user input: Ask the user for two numbers and the type of operation they want to perform.

Handle invalid input: Ensure that the user enters valid numbers and a valid operation to prevent errors.

Repeat the process: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
How It Works:
Functions:

add(): Adds two numbers.
subtract(): Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiply(): Multiplies two numbers.
divide(): Divides the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, it returns an error message.
Main loop:

Displays a list of operations the user can choose from.
Accepts input for the operation and the numbers to be calculated.
Uses if-elif conditions to perform the chosen operation and calls the corresponding function.
Input validation:

Checks if the user enters a valid option for the operation.
Handles division by zero, preventing the program from crashing when dividing by zero.
Loop:

The loop continues to prompt the user for calculations until they choose option 5 to quit.
